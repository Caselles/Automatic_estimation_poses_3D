Automatic estimation of 3D human poses from videos.
---------------------------------------

In this directory you can find a report of a computer vision project for the ENS Cachan MVA Master's course "Object recognition and Computer vision".

In this project, the goal was to extend the work of Bogo et Al. on 3D human pose estimation in still images to videos. We find a way to adapt the model to videos, by accounting for the continuity in videos.
Our work was tested on instructions videos, some results are available on YouTube : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCZOwggVKD4&feature=youtu.be .
